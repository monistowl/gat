# gat-dist

`gat-dist` bundles distribution-domain tools such as MATPOWER import, AC power-flow/OPF runners, and hosting-capacity sweeps that emit dist-specific Parquet artifacts.

Consult `docs/guide/pf.md`, `docs/guide/opf.md`, and `docs/guide/scaling.md` for how the CLI consumes these helpers when you build custom workflows or combine them with the `gat-cli` commands.
