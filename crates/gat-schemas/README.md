# gat-schemas

`gat-schemas` holds placeholder schema helpers that will eventually formalize the Arrow/Parquet tables used by the CLI and analytics crates.

It currently exposes high-level helpers for dist/derms/adms tables; consult `docs/guide/scaling.md` and the generated artifacts under `docs/schemas/` for the schema expectations.
