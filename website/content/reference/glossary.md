# Power Systems Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of terms used in power systems analysis and throughout GAT documentation.

---

## A

### AC (Alternating Current)
Electric current that periodically reverses direction. Power grids use AC because it can be easily transformed to different voltage levels. In North America, AC alternates at 60 Hz; in Europe, 50 Hz.

### AC Power Flow
Analysis that solves the full nonlinear power flow equations, accounting for both real power (P) and reactive power (Q), voltage magnitudes and angles. More accurate than DC power flow but computationally harder. See [Power Flow Guide](/guide/pf/).

### Active Power
See [Real Power](#real-power-p).

### Admittance (Y)
The inverse of impedance. Measures how easily current flows through a circuit element. Complex quantity: Y = G + jB, where G is conductance and B is susceptance. Units: Siemens (S). See [Impedance & Admittance](/reference/impedance-admittance/).

### ADMS (Advanced Distribution Management System)
Software platform that integrates SCADA, outage management, and distribution automation. GAT's `gat-adms` crate provides FLISR and VVO algorithms. See [ADMS Guide](/guide/adms/).

### Angle
Voltage angle (θ) at a bus, measured in radians or degrees relative to a reference bus. Angle differences drive real power flow: larger Δθ means more MW flowing.

### Apparent Power (S)
The magnitude of complex power: S = √(P² + Q²). Measured in volt-amperes (VA) or megavolt-amperes (MVA). Determines equipment sizing because conductors must carry both real and reactive current. See [Complex Power](/reference/complex-power/).

### Area
A geographic or administrative region of the power grid, often corresponding to a utility or balancing authority. Multi-area analysis considers power transfers between areas via tie-lines (corridors).

### Arrow (Apache Arrow)
Columnar in-memory data format used by GAT for high-performance data interchange. GAT stores networks as Arrow directory datasets with separate tables for buses, branches, generators, and loads. See [Arrow Schema](/guide/arrow-schema/).

---

## B

### Bad Data
Measurements in state estimation that are inconsistent with the physical model. Bad data detection identifies and removes erroneous measurements before estimating system state.

### Balancing Authority
Entity responsible for maintaining load-generation balance in a control area. Must continuously adjust generation to match demand and maintain frequency.

### Base MVA (Sbase)
Reference power used for per-unit calculations. Typical values: 100 MVA for transmission, 1-10 MVA for distribution. All per-unit quantities are ratios relative to this base.

### Base Voltage (Vbase)
Reference voltage for per-unit calculations, typically the nominal voltage at each bus. Combined with base MVA, determines base impedance: Zbase = Vbase² / Sbase.

### Branch
A transmission line or transformer connecting two buses. Characterized by impedance (R + jX), thermal rating, and optionally a tap ratio (for transformers). GAT stores branches in `branches.arrow`.

### Branch Flow Model
OPF formulation using branch power flows as variables instead of bus injections. The Farivar-Low SOCP relaxation uses this model. Naturally handles radial networks.

### Bus
A node in the power network where components connect. Buses have voltage magnitude and angle. Types include slack (reference), PV (generator), and PQ (load). GAT stores buses in `buses.arrow`.

### Bus Type
Classification determining which quantities are known vs. solved:
- **Slack (Ref, Type 3)**: V and θ fixed; P and Q solved
- **PV (Type 2)**: P and V fixed; Q and θ solved
- **PQ (Type 1)**: P and Q fixed; V and θ solved

See [Bus Types](/reference/bus-types/) for a detailed explanation.

---

## C

### Capability Curve
A generator's operating envelope in the P-Q plane, showing feasible combinations of real and reactive power output. Limited by field current, armature current, and prime mover.

### Capacitor Bank
Shunt device that injects reactive power to raise voltage. Switched capacitor banks provide discrete voltage control; static VAR compensators (SVCs) provide continuous control.

### CAIFI (Customer Average Interruption Frequency Index)
Reliability metric: average number of interruptions per customer affected. CAIFI = (Total interruptions) / (Customers affected). Lower is better.

### Charging (Line Charging)
Capacitive reactive power generated by transmission line shunt capacitance. Modeled as B/2 at each end in the π-model. Significant for long high-voltage lines.

### Clarabel
Interior-point conic solver used by GAT for SOCP relaxation of OPF. Handles second-order cone constraints efficiently.

### Conductance (G)
Real part of admittance. Represents resistive losses. G = R / (R² + X²).

### Conductor
Physical wire carrying current. Conductor properties (resistance, ampacity) determine branch parameters and thermal limits.

### Congestion
When power flow on a branch approaches or exceeds its thermal limit. Congestion creates price separation (different LMPs) between buses.

### Contingency
A hypothetical failure event (e.g., loss of a generator or transmission line). Contingency analysis tests whether the system can survive such events. See [N-1](#n-1-criterion) and [Contingency Analysis](/reference/contingency-analysis/).

### Convergence
When an iterative solver reaches a solution within acceptable tolerance. Power flow typically converges in 3-10 Newton-Raphson iterations. Non-convergence may indicate an infeasible operating point.

### Corridor
In multi-area analysis, a tie-line connecting two areas with limited transfer capacity. GAT's `Corridor` type models inter-area power transfers.

### Cost Model
Function relating generator output to operating cost. Common forms:
- **Quadratic**: Cost = c₀ + c₁·P + c₂·P²
- **Piecewise linear**: Segments with different slopes
- **No cost**: For must-run units or renewables

---

## D

### DC Power Flow
Linearized approximation assuming: (1) voltage magnitudes ≈ 1.0 p.u., (2) angle differences are small, (3) resistance << reactance. Solves Bθ = P, a linear system. Fast but ignores reactive power and losses.

### DC-OPF

### DERMS (Distributed Energy Resource Management System)
Software coordinating DER dispatch, aggregation, and grid services. See [DERMS Guide](/guide/derms/).

### Dispatch
The real-time allocation of generation to meet demand. Economic dispatch minimizes cost; security-constrained dispatch also respects transmission limits.

---

## E

### Economic Dispatch
Optimization to minimize generation cost while meeting demand. Ignores network constraints (copper-plate assumption). The simplest OPF variant.

### ELCC (Effective Load Carrying Capability)
Capacity credit of a variable resource (wind, solar). The additional load the system can serve while maintaining the same reliability level. Accounts for resource variability.

### ENS (Energy Not Served)
Reliability metric: total energy (MWh) that cannot be delivered due to capacity shortfalls. Also called Expected Unserved Energy (EUE).

### EUE (Expected Unserved Energy)
See [ENS](#ens-energy-not-served).

### Exciter
Generator component controlling field current and thus terminal voltage. Automatic voltage regulators (AVRs) adjust excitation to maintain voltage setpoint.

---

## F

### Fast Decoupled Power Flow
Newton-Raphson variant exploiting P-θ and Q-V decoupling. Uses constant Jacobian approximations (B' and B'') for faster iterations. Good for well-conditioned transmission networks.

### Fault
An abnormal current path, usually a short circuit. Types include three-phase, line-to-line, line-to-ground. Protection systems detect and isolate faults.

### Feasibility
A power flow or OPF solution is feasible if all constraints are satisfied: power balance, voltage limits, thermal limits, generator limits.

### Flat Start
Initial guess for iterative solvers: V = 1.0 p.u., θ = 0 for all buses. Simple but may cause convergence issues for stressed systems. GAT's AC-OPF uses flat start by default.

### FLISR (Fault Location, Isolation, Service Restoration)
Distribution automation sequence: locate fault, isolate faulted section, restore service to unaffected customers via alternate feeds. See [ADMS Guide](/guide/adms/).

### Flow Limit
See [Thermal Limit](#thermal-limit).

### FOR (Forced Outage Rate)
Probability that a unit is unavailable due to unplanned failure. Used in reliability calculations. Typical values: 2-10% for thermal units.

### Frequency
System frequency (50 or 60 Hz) indicates generation-load balance. Frequency drops when load exceeds generation; rises when generation exceeds load.

---

## G

### Generation

### IPOPT (Interior Point Optimizer)
Industry-standard nonlinear optimization solver. GAT's `solver-ipopt` feature enables IPOPT backend for AC-OPF.
