# AI-Powered GAT Script Generator

Use AI assistants to generate power systems analysis scripts with GAT. We provide pre-built prompts with full GAT context that you can use with:

- **Google Gemini** (free tier, generous limits)
- **ChatGPT** (free tier)
- **Claude** (copy prompts)
- **DeepSeek** (free tier)

## How It Works

1. **Pick a use case** - Select from common power systems analysis tasks
2. **Review the prompt** - See the GAT context and requirements pre-loaded
3. **Generate** - Use the built-in Gemini integration or copy to your preferred AI
4. **Run** - Copy the generated commands to your terminal

All prompts include:
- GAT command reference and syntax
- Input/output data formats (Arrow, Parquet, CSV)
- Common workflows and best practices
- Error handling patterns
