# GAT Documentation

Comprehensive guides for the Grid Analysis Toolkit

Auto-generated docs live under CLI, schemas, and Arrow layouts. The xtask targets keep the Markdown, manifest schema, and CLI output definitions versioned with the code.

For a high-level explanation of the architecture, including the dispatcher and modular command handlers, see the CLI Architecture guide.
