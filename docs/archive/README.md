# Archive index

These files capture legacy narrative docs that have been superseded by the current guides and roadmap. Start with the active guides under `docs/guide/` and the canonical roadmap at `docs/ROADMAP.md`; fall back to these archives for additional context or future reconciliations.

- `DATASETS.md` – early notes on dataset sourcing/imports; cross-check with the CLI `import` commands before reusing.
- `DOCS_OVERHAUL.md` – original brainstorming for how to reorganize documentation (replaced by `docs/beads/documentation_overhaul.md`).
- `GUI.md` – initial GUI layout sketch; see `docs/ROADMAP.md` milestone M7 for the current plan.
- `OPF.md` – legacy OPF how-to; the refreshed version lives at `docs/guide/opf.md`.
- `PACKAGING.md` – draft packaging/install ideas; align with the installer notes in `docs/ROADMAP.md` milestone M10.
- `ROADMAP.md` – archived roadmap copy; `docs/ROADMAP.md` is authoritative.
- `SCALING.md` – multi-horizon scaling roadmap; a distilled “what to do now” view is at `docs/guide/scaling.md`.
- `SE.md` – legacy WLS doc; the current guide is `docs/guide/state_estimation.md`.
- `TS.md` – time-series tips; fold into future guide updates when the TS CLI stabilizes.
- `VIZ.md` – visualization sketch; coordinate with the GUI plans in the roadmap before reviving.

When promoting content out of the archive, update cross-links to the new `docs/guide/` locations and remove stale instructions that no longer match the CLI.
