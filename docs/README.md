# GAT Auto-Docs

The `docs/` tree is generated by `cargo xtask doc:*`.

## Helpful commands

- `cargo xtask doc cli`: regenerate the Markdown CLI reference and the `gat.1` man page for the current code.
- `cargo xtask doc schemas`: emit JSON schemas (manifest + Arrow outputs) into `docs/schemas/`.
- `cargo xtask doc site`: build a minimal `site/book/` stub that links into the generated docs.
- `cargo xtask doc all`: run every doc target in order.

These commands also keep `docs/index.md` and the guide in sync with the CLI so the MCP server can expose a single authoritative tree.
