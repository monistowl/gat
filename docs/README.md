# GAT Auto-Docs

The `docs/` tree is regenerated by `cargo xtask doc:*` and also hosts curated guides that stay in sync with the CLI.

## Helpful commands

- `cargo xtask doc cli`: regenerate the Markdown CLI reference and the `gat.1` man page for the current code.
- `cargo xtask doc schemas`: emit JSON schemas (manifest + Arrow outputs) into `docs/schemas/`.
- `cargo xtask doc site`: build a minimal `site/book/` stub that links into the generated docs.
- `cargo xtask doc all`: run every doc target in order.

These commands also keep `docs/index.md` and the guide in sync with the CLI so the MCP server can expose a single authoritative tree.

Manual docs live alongside the generated assets:

- `docs/ROADMAP.md` is the canonical roadmap (previously at repo root).
- `docs/archive/` holds legacy narrative docs that still need to be reconciled; see `docs/beads/documentation_overhaul.md` for the migration plan.
