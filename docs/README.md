# GAT Auto-Docs

The `docs/` tree is regenerated by `cargo xtask doc:*` and also hosts curated guides that stay in sync with the CLI.

## Helpful commands

- `cargo xtask doc cli`: regenerate the Markdown CLI reference and the `gat.1` man page for the current code.
- `cargo xtask doc schemas`: emit JSON schemas (manifest + Arrow outputs) into `docs/schemas/`.
- `cargo xtask doc site`: build a minimal `site/book/` stub that links into the generated docs.
- `cargo xtask doc all`: run every doc target in order.

These commands also keep `docs/index.md` and the guide in sync with the CLI so the MCP server can expose a single authoritative tree.

## What is safe to edit manually?

- **Do edit:** the guide pages under `docs/guide/` and the roadmap at `docs/ROADMAP.md`. These are versioned manually and should reflect the shipped CLI behavior.
- **Do not edit:** generated artifacts under `docs/cli/`, `docs/man/`, `docs/schemas/`, or `docs/arrow/`—refresh them via `cargo xtask doc ...` instead.
- **Archived references:** older narrative docs live in `docs/archive/` and are cataloged at `docs/archive/README.md`; update them only when reconciling historical content into the guide.
