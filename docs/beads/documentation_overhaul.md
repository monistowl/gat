# Documentation overhaul plan

This plan decomposes the documentation cleanup so CLI agents can execute the overhaul incrementally without disrupting the auto-generated docs in `docs/`. Tasks are ordered and scoped so each bead is a self-contained change.

## Guiding principles
- Keep the top-level `README.md` as the single landing page; everything else lives under `docs/`.
- Preserve the most complete roadmap (now `docs/ROADMAP.md`) and only update narrative to reflect shipped features or known deltas.
- Avoid editing files maintained by `cargo xtask doc:*` except through those generators.

## Bead 1: Normalize file layout
- [x] Create a `docs/archive/` index page summarizing what each legacy document covers (DATASETS, GUI, OPF, SE, TS, VIZ, PACKAGING, SCALING) and where newer equivalents live.
- [x] Add links from `docs/index.md` or `docs/guide/` landing pages to the archive index so autogenerated navigation still surfaces background material.
- [x] Update intra-doc links inside the moved legacy files so they point to their new `docs/archive/` paths.

## Bead 2: Reconcile roadmap(s)
- [x] Compare `docs/ROADMAP.md` with any roadmap content in `docs/archive/ROADMAP.md`; keep the fullest set of acceptance criteria.
- [x] Add a short status line per milestone noting what is implemented (DC PF/OPF, N-1, WLS) versus planned (AC PF/OPF, GUI polish, packaging).
- [x] Ensure `README.md` and `docs/index.md` link to the canonical roadmap location.

## Bead 3: Align with autogenerated docs
- [ ] Run `cargo xtask doc all` to refresh generated CLI/man/schema docs after the move and verify `docs/index.md` still lists the regenerated guides. (Blocked: workspace lacks `crates/gat-core/Cargo.toml`, so the `cargo xtask doc all` target currently fails.)
- [x] Add a short contributor note (in `docs/README.md` or `docs/guide/`) explaining which files are generated and how to regenerate them so manual edits do not get clobbered.

## Bead 4: Content refresh for key guides
- [x] Identify the most complete topical guides in `docs/archive/` (e.g., OPF, SE, SCALING, VIZ) and promote the current versions into `docs/guide/` as living docs, pruning duplicate/obsolete sections.
- [x] Ensure examples reference current CLI flags and file locations (e.g., Parquet outputs, schema paths).
- [x] Add TODO callouts for any gaps that need fresh diagrams or sample data.

## Bead 5: Workflow validation
- [ ] After migration, run `cargo test` (or targeted doc generation checks) to confirm no paths in tests or build scripts assume the old `docs_old/` layout. (Pending: workspace build is currently blocked by the missing `crates/gat-core/Cargo.toml` manifest.)
- [x] Add a brief checklist to `docs/beads/` capturing what was verified (links, `xtask` outputs, README references).

### Validation log
- Links updated: `docs/index.md` and `docs/guide/overview.md` now route to the archive index and canonical roadmap.
- Layout change: `docs_old/` removed; legacy docs cataloged under `docs/archive/README.md` with inline archive notices.
- Roadmap reconciliation: `docs/ROADMAP.md` annotated with milestone status; root `ROADMAP.md` points to the canonical copy.
- Generation attempt: `cargo xtask doc all` currently fails because `crates/gat-core/Cargo.toml` is missing (workspace incomplete).

## Exit criteria
- All standalone docs (other than the root README) live under `docs/` with working links.
- Contributors understand which files are generated and how to refresh them.
- Roadmap and guides accurately note current feature status and planned work.
