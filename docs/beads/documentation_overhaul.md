# Documentation overhaul plan

This plan decomposes the documentation cleanup so CLI agents can execute the overhaul incrementally without disrupting the auto-generated docs in `docs/`. Tasks are ordered and scoped so each bead is a self-contained change.

## Guiding principles
- Keep the top-level `README.md` as the single landing page; everything else lives under `docs/`.
- Preserve the most complete roadmap (now `docs/ROADMAP.md`) and only update narrative to reflect shipped features or known deltas.
- Avoid editing files maintained by `cargo xtask doc:*` except through those generators.

## Bead 1: Normalize file layout
- [ ] Create a `docs/archive/` index page summarizing what each legacy document covers (DATASETS, GUI, OPF, SE, TS, VIZ, PACKAGING, SCALING) and where newer equivalents live.
- [ ] Add links from `docs/index.md` or `docs/guide/` landing pages to the archive index so autogenerated navigation still surfaces background material.
- [ ] Update intra-doc links inside the moved legacy files so they point to their new `docs/archive/` paths.

## Bead 2: Reconcile roadmap(s)
- [ ] Compare `docs/ROADMAP.md` with any roadmap content in `docs/archive/ROADMAP.md`; keep the fullest set of acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Add a short status line per milestone noting what is implemented (DC PF/OPF, N-1, WLS) versus planned (AC PF/OPF, GUI polish, packaging).
- [ ] Ensure `README.md` and `docs/index.md` link to the canonical roadmap location.

## Bead 3: Align with autogenerated docs
- [ ] Run `cargo xtask doc all` to refresh generated CLI/man/schema docs after the move and verify `docs/index.md` still lists the regenerated guides.
- [ ] Add a short contributor note (in `docs/README.md` or `docs/guide/`) explaining which files are generated and how to regenerate them so manual edits do not get clobbered.

## Bead 4: Content refresh for key guides
- [ ] Identify the most complete topical guides in `docs/archive/` (e.g., OPF, SE, SCALING, VIZ) and promote the current versions into `docs/guide/` as living docs, pruning duplicate/obsolete sections.
- [ ] Ensure examples reference current CLI flags and file locations (e.g., Parquet outputs, schema paths).
- [ ] Add TODO callouts for any gaps that need fresh diagrams or sample data.

## Bead 5: Workflow validation
- [ ] After migration, run `cargo test` (or targeted doc generation checks) to confirm no paths in tests or build scripts assume the old `docs_old/` layout.
- [ ] Add a brief checklist to `docs/beads/` capturing what was verified (links, `xtask` outputs, README references).

## Exit criteria
- All standalone docs (other than the root README) live under `docs/` with working links.
- Contributors understand which files are generated and how to refresh them.
- Roadmap and guides accurately note current feature status and planned work.
